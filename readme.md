### *A web app to help celebrate the 5th annual D4K charity party.*<br>

This year, we partnered with two Atlanta based charities, The Nicholas House and True Change. We raised our goal from $2,500 to $4,000 this year and, once again, we doubled our goal with a grand total of **$9,808** raised! With corporate matches, we were able to donate more than **$27,000** in total.
